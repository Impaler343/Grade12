#A function is a subprogram that acts on data and often returns a value
#USEFULNESS
#To break code into smaller parts
#To reduce lines by calling functions

#Program execution begins with the first statement of the __main__ segment
#Built in Functions - Predefined functions that are always available for use(len,type,int,input)
#Module functions - Predefined in particular modules and can be used if the modules are imported(math,statistics)
#User Defined Functions - Defined by the programmer
#Parameters/Formal parameters/Formal arguments - Values received in the function definition/function header
#Arguments/Actual parameters/Actual arguments - The values being passed through the function call statement 
#When the function call statement must match the number and order of arguments as defined, in the function header, it is called positional argument matching
#A parameter having a default value in the function header is called default parameter
#Keyword arguments are the named arguments with assigned values being passed in the function call statement
#A function may return multiple values that may be received as a tuple or as individual variables
#Functions that return value are called fruitful or non-void functions
#Functions that dont return a value are called non-fruitful or void functions
#The program parts in which a particular variable, piece of code or data value is legal and can be accessed is called Variable Scope
#LEGB Rule (Local,Enclosing,Global,Builtin) means a local variable having the same name as a global variable, hides the global variable in its function
#The global statement cannot be undone in a code block, once declared global, it cant be reverted back to local
#A namespace is a named logical environment holding groups of related objects; its member object is referred without any prefix
#A namespace is a collection of names that uniquely identifies an object. Implemented with the help of dictionaries(WOW, thats why the recently defined function is executed remember?)
#The system stores names and local variables of a function in the area of memory called stack
#When a program execution starts, a global namespace is created and after execution it is removed, same for a function call and its local arguments
#The time for which a variable or name remains in memory is called its Lifetime
#Heap memory is the one used during runtime
#When dynamic typing happens, if a particular object is not used for a long time, the garbage collector empties it

#Docstring - Tripled quoted multiline comments usually used to describe a function or a module

#In pass by reference, the variable is passed into the function directly. The variable acts a Package that comes with itâ€™s contents(the objects). 
#Any operation performed by the function on the variable or the object will be directly reflected to the function caller.(MUTABLE TYPES, lists and all)
#The function receives the reference of the same object in the memory as referred by the caller.

#In pass by value the function is provided with a copy of the argument object passed to it by the caller. That means the original object stays intact. 
#All changes made are to a copy of the same and stored at different memory locations.(IMMUTABLE TYPES, strings int and all)
#The function creates an entirely new variable for itself.

#RULES for parameters and calling :- sample header -- def interest(prin,cc,rate = 0.9,time=2)
#Positional arguments be followed by default and keyword arguments eg: interest(rate=0.8,5000,3) is wrong
#You cannot give multiple values to an argument while calling it eg: interest(5000,prin = 800,cc=4) is wrong (prin assigned twice)
#All positional arguments must be assigned values in the call eg: interest(500) is wrong (cc is missing)
#If all are keyword arguments, they can be in any order

#Function Body - The indented statements
#Indentation - The blank space at the beginning of a block
#print(__name__) will give __main__, else if the script is running another imported module, the __name__ will have __thenameofthemodule__

#know the difference between return and print and both at the same time and their order

# def yay():
#     print('oppg')
#     #return 'popg' #OR no return statement
# print(yay()) #OR just yay()

# def f(a,b):
#     global x,y #NO error, a global is created
#     x = a+b
#     a,y=a+x,a*x
#     print(a,b,x,y)
# f(5,10)
# print(f(b=x,a=y))

# def check(a):
#     for i in range(len(a)):
#         a[i] = a[i] + 5
#     a = a + [10]
#     return a
# b = [1,2,3,4]
# c = check(b)
# print(c,b) # [6,7,8,9,10] [6,7,8,9]
